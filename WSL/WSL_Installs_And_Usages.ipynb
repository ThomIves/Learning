    "* Integration: WSL enables seamless integration between Windows and Linux, allowing you to use both Windows and Linux command-line tools and GUI applications.\n",
    "* Performance: WSL provides improved performance compared to traditional virtual machines, as it runs Linux binaries natively on Windows without the need for hardware virtualization.\n",
    "* Compatibility: WSL ensures compatibility between development and production environments, making it easier for web developers and those working with Linux-first tools to use their tools on Windows.\n",
    "* Ease of installation: Installing WSL has become simpler over time. You can install WSL by opening an elevated Command Prompt window and running the wsl --install command.\n",
